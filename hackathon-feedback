New year countdown app
Congrats on your first hackathon!
I can see your understanding in DOM manipulation and functions.
Your code is simple and works.
I would like to see some more things you have learnt in class like conditionals and loops.
Also next time try to make the website responsive.. ( sizing the text depending on the size of the screen..)
Nice!
